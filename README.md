# tidymodels-tutorial
This is a brief high-level tutorial for the tidymodels package. This tutorial was originally created by Gavin McDonald for an EcoDataScience session on November 19, 2019. However, I hope it can be helpful for other purposes as well. Feel free to get in touch: gmcdonald@bren.ucsb.edu

Included in this repo are two resources:  

1. `introduction_presentation` - Introductory presentation to tidymodels (includes both a slidy `.Rmd` file and an `.html` file)  
2. `live_session` - A simple live session demonstratic basic tidymodels functionality (includes both a notebook `.Rmd` file and an `.html` file)
