## Session overview

This is *not* a comprehensive overview of predictive modeling (*a.k.a.* machine learning)

For that, see Max Kuhn's fantastic [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com) (he'll also be teaching a short course at next year's `rstudio:conf`)

This *is* a high-level overview of what's possible using the new `tidymodels` universe of R packages

## Tidymodels packages

`tidymodels` packages include (among others):   

* `rsample` - data sampling    
* `recipes` - data pre-processing  
* `parsnip` - unified modeling interface  
* `yardstick` - measuring model performance  
* `dials` - hyperparameter tuning
* `probably` - post-processing class probabilities 

Loading `tidymodels` also loads some `tidyverse` packages:  

* `dplyr`
* `ggplot2` 
* `purrr`
